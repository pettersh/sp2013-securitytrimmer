# ADFS Security Trimmer Example
By *Petter Skodvin-Hvammen - [Principal Consultant at Puzzlepart](http://www.puzzlapart.com)*

This is an example implementation of a custom security trimmer. The example was made for my **European SharePoint Conference 2015** session named [Hybrid Search Bonanza - Cloud SSA vs Custom Claims Provider and Security Trimmer](http://www.sharepointeurope.com/conferences/session/445/hybrid-search-bonanza--cloud-ssa-vs-custom-claims-provider-and-security-trimmer-level-400)

The code is simplified and intended for illustration only. For production quality:

- add caching for low latency and high troughput
- add error handling and logging
- add externalized configuration
- refactor for maintainability
